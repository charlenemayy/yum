# 3D Pacman
This is my first game I made with the Three.js library and I mostly made it for experimentation, so it may be a little glitchy.

# To Play
1. Download ZIP files by clicking the green button in the top right corner
2. Extract files and open `index.html` in Firefox (Opening local web files will not work in Chrome or Safari)
